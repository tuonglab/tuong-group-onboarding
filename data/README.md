# write

This folder will contain all the data files that you start with. I've written in the `.gitignore` to ignore this location, so you can save your data here without worrying about accidentally uploading it to github. Please delete this section and replace it with your own if you are using this template.

## File information

It would be good to annotate here what each file means. For example, if you have a file called `data.csv`, you can write a short description of what it is here.

```
01_data.csv: contains the data for the project
02_metadata.csv: contains the metadata for the project
```
