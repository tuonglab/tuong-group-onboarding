# write

This folder will contain all the data files that you will save. I've written in the `.gitignore` to ignore this location, so you can save your data here without worrying about accidentally uploading it to github.

## File information

It would be good to annotate here what each file means. For example, if you have a file called `data.csv`, you can write a short description of what it is here.

```
01_data.csv: contains the data for the project
02_metadata.csv: contains the metadata for the project
```
