# notebooks

This directory contains the jupyter notebooks used in the projects.

## File information

It would be good to annotate here what each notebook was used for. For example, if you have a notebook called `01_data_cleanup.ipynb`, you can write a short description of what it is here.

```
01_data_cleanup.ipynb: cleans up the data and prepares it for analysis. Includes celltype annotation and QC. Haven't done the clustering yet.
02_clustering.ipynb: clusters the data using the Louvain algorithm
```
