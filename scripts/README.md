# scripts

This directory contains scripts used in the projects that are not necessarily notebooks.

For example, you might have a script that runs a program that you wrote in another language, or a script that downloads data from a database. You call these scripts from the notebooks and this is where you store them.

Please delete this section and replace it with your own if you are using this template.

## File information

It would be good to annotate here what each script means. For example, if you have a script called `download_data.py`, you can write a short description of what it is here.

```
01_download_data.py: downloads data from the database at https://www.example.com
02_run_program.py: runs the <what> program that I wrote in python
03_run_program.R: runs the program that I wrote in R
```
