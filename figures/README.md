# figures

This directory contains any figures generated by the code in the notebooks and scripts. I've written in the `.gitignore` to ignore this location, so you can save your data here without worrying about accidentally uploading it to github.

Please delete this section and replace it with your own if you are using this template.

## File information

It would be good to annotate here what each figure means. For example, if you have a figure called `01_data.png`, you can write a short description of what it is here.

```
01_data.png: UMAP plot of all the metadata
02_cancer.png: barplot of the cancer types
03_age.png: histogram of the age of the patients
```
