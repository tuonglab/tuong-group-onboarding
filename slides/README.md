# slides

This directory contains the powerpoint slides you created for the project.

Please delete this section and replace it with your own if you are using this template.

## File information

It would be good to annotate here what each ppt was used for. For example, if you have a ppt called `project_summary_030422`, you can write a short description of what it is here.

```
project_summary_030422: summary of the project to date with the results corresponding to what i've done in terms of data cleaning and clustering
```
